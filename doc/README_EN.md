## What's xtray？

-------------------

xtray = extra + xray-core；

Literally, xtray is designed to be a powerful client for xray-core.

It supports protocols like vmess, vless, shadowsocks(ss), trojan, etc.

Xtray also takes advantage of the free vpn collection project [free](https://github.com/moqsien/free). You can maintain your own repositories in case you have your own free vpn resources. The only thing you need to change is the download url for xtray in its config file.

An active shell is also provided by xtray for controls on daemonized xtray processes. You can also download Switchy-Omega for Google-Chrome/Chromium, as well as that geoip.dat/geosite.dat required by xray-core.

Xtray will filter out usable vpns for you automatically.

Just enjoy yourself!
